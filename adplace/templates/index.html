    <p>Dear Ladies & Gentlemen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your interest in advertising on the Quickfinda!</p>

    <!-- <p>Nairaland runs a Targeted Ad Platform with which any Nairaland member can place adverts on the sections of Nairaland where the people he/she wants to reach are most likely to be found (for example, a political party could place ads on the politics section with it).</p> -->

    <p>To place ads on Quickfinda, the first step is to get your ad banner designed by a good graphic designer. Your ad banner must be borderless, 318 pixels wide, 106 pixels tall, less than 30kb in size, and in the PNG or JPG format. Once it's ready, go to www.nairaland.com/campaign and click (Upload Ad) to upload your banner ad and landing page, and wait for approval. (Your ad might not be approved if it's deceptive or illegal or morally questionable in some way).</p>

    <p>After your ad is approved, we will provide you with information about how to purchase advertising credits so you can freely place your ads on any section of Quickfinda - including the home page. Our system is extremely simple by design.</p>

    <p>Please see our Estimated Advertising Rates to find out how much it'll cost to advertise on the various sections of Quickfinda on the long run (prices on the short term are strongly correlated with traffic levels). Billing takes place every few minutes and you will get detailed reports on unique clicks and views and charges for each ad/section and for your entire account over various time periods.</p>

    <p>We look forward to doing business with you!</p>
